Implementation of a neural network for part of speech assignment task for university programming project

The file containing the neural network implementation is NN.py. It comes along with explanatory commentaries inside (in french). 

d_v stands for dict_vectorizer, l_e for label_encoder, in pickle format. 

first, second and third are 3 models trained with the neural network.
